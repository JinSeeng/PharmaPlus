# PharmaPlus

### Project presentation: OOP Java stock management  
The aim of this project is to develop a stock management application for a pharmacy using the principles of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. The application will operate in **console mode** and will enable pharmacists to **manage products**, **track orders** and **analyse stocks** efficiently.  

Development will follow an agile approach, with use of **Git** to ensure good version control.  

### Project objectives  
The main objective is to provide an intuitive and robust **solution** to manage stocks and orders for a pharmacy. Key features include:  
âœ… Product management: adding, modifying and consulting stocks.  
âœ… Order processing: creation, tracking and sales history.  
âœ… User management: roles and permissions for access to the application.  
âœ… Backup and statistics: data retention and performance analysis.  

### **OOP principles applied**  

The project implements several advanced OOP concepts:  
ðŸ”¹ Abstract classes (User) to define common roles.  
ðŸ”¹ Interfaces (Stockable, Serializable) to ensure code flexibility and modularity.  
ðŸ”¹ Polymorphism to manage different operations on commands and users.  
ðŸ”¹ Composition and aggregation to structure relationships between products, categories and orders.  
ðŸ”¹ Search and sorting algorithms to optimise stock management.
