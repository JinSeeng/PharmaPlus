# PharmaPlus

### Project presentation: Pharmacy stock management in Java OOP  
The aim of this project is to develop a stock management application for a pharmacy using the principles of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. The application will operate in **console mode** and will enable pharmacists to **manage products**, **track orders** and **analyse stocks** efficiently.  

Development will follow an agile approach, with use of **Git** to ensure good version control.  

### Project objectives  
The main objective is to provide an intuitive and robust **solution** to manage stocks and orders for a pharmacy. Key features include:  
✅ **Product management**: adding, modifying and consulting stocks.  
✅ **Order processing**: creation, tracking and sales history.  
✅ **User management**: roles and permissions for access to the application.  
✅ **Backup and statistics**: data retention and performance analysis.  

### OOP principles applied  

The project implements several advanced OOP concepts:  
🔹 **Abstract classes** (User) to define common roles.  
🔹 **Interfaces** (Stockable, Serializable) to ensure code flexibility and modularity.  
🔹 **Polymorphism** to manage different operations on commands and users.  
🔹 **Composition and aggregation** to structure relationships between products, categories and orders.  
🔹 **Search and sorting algorithms** to optimise stock management.  

### Testing the application
To test the application, you can log in directly in your console using these predefined user accounts:

⚙️ **Administrator account**: Use the username "admin" and the password "admin123". [Only administrators can create/add new users]  
⚙️ **Employee account**: Use the username "employee" and the password "employee123".
